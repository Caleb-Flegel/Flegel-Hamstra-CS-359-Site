##Selected Company: _Antigen_
####[Company Website] (https://www.antiverse.io)

  The company I selected is called Antiverse and is based in Cardiff. Started in 2017 by partners Ben Holland and Murat Tunaboylu, the company seeks to aid in the advancement of drug discovery. Specifically, the company seeks to aid researchers in finding antibodies that could be used in drugs and vaccines. The company has employed “next-generation sequencing” and their Augmented Drug Discovery platform to analyze the work done by the scientists in the lab and suggest solutions. Antigen presents three areas in which their software can help researchers. 
	
  The first way their software can aid researchers is through “targeted selection”. When a team finds too many antigen-binding options to effectively process, the software will attempt to try to narrow the options to the best binders. This is in the hope that the software will help much of the trial-and-error a lab needs to go through to find the right antibody.
	
  The second way Antigen claims to help labs is through what they call “binder recovery”. Binder recovery seems to be targeted at labs and scientists struggling to find an antibody that binds to a target sufficiently. The software is advertised to be able to look back at the data and suggest binders that were missed by the methods that the scientists used. This would help scientists speed up the antibody development process by potentially not needing to re-run tests to get the right binder. 
	
  Finally, “binder customization” is the third way Antigen says their software can help labs. This option is supposed to suggest customized variants of antibodies to researchers who aren’t quite happy with how their antibody is performing. This may help researchers not have to go through another round of searching to find a better-performing binder. 
	
  In addition, Antigen looks quite promising from a business perspective. They claim that the commitment labs need to make toward their AI-Augmented Drug Discovery software is “surprisingly minimal and risk-free.” Back in March, the company announced it had raised $2 million in investment money and was working with “major pharma companies.” (https://pharmaphorum.com/news/welsh-startup-antiverse-raises-2m-for-antibody-discovery-toolkit/) Finally, according to the company’s Twitter page, they are still very active and have recently hired multiple new employees. 
	
  Overall, Antigen seems to be a very unique and promising startup we could potentially gg visit in Cardiff.
